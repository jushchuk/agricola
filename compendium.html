<h1>The Unofficial Agricola Compendium</h1>
<p class="version">Version 9.0 (2010-12-17)</p>
<div id="intro"><p>This is a complete list of minor improvements and occupations in the game Agricola.</p>
<br />
<p>Each entry in this list contains the card text, the clarifications given in the appendix of the rulebook (where available), and a number of additional rulings. Many of these rulings are based on clarifications by Uwe Rosenberg, the game author, and Hanno Girke of Lookout Games. New rulings will be added when they're posted on BoardGameGeek or the Lookout-Games.de forums.</p>
<br />
<p>Some of the rulings have been made up entirely by me. These rulings are entirely unofficial, and can be changed at all times, for example when the game author contradicts them. These unofficial rulings are in italics <span class="ecp">like this</span>, and can be accepted or ignored as you wish.</p>
<br />
<p>This document is based on the German second edition of the game. The translation is based on (but not the same as) the translation by Melissa Rogerson.</p> </div>
